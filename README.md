# Plots for investigating Rasch model fit

We provide functions for visualisation of, e.g., Rasch item fit and DIF using a Conditional Item Characteristic Curve (CICC). 

## Motivation and purpose

## Installation

This is an *R* package. [*R*](https://www.r-project.org/) is required,
[*RStudio*](https://www.rstudio.com/) is recommended.


The package is available on GitHub. To install the package, start by installing the `devtools` package. The best way to do this is from CRAN, by typing:

```{}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Install the `RASCHplot` package from GitHub using the following code.

```{}
devtools::install_github("ERRTG/RASCHplot", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

After installing the package has to be attached as usual:

```{}
library(RASCHplot)
```

And you are ready to go!
