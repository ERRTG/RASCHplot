Title: Conditional Item Characteristic Curves for Rasch models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Karl Bang Christensen,  Sidsel Normann Jensen and Ann-Sophie Buchardt
Maintainer: Ann-Sophie Buchardt <asbu@sund.ku.dk>
Description: Visualization of Rasch item fit using the Conditional Item Characteristic Curve (CICC) which describes the expected item mean as a function of the total score. An empirical CICC is made based on the observed data as both the empirical expected item score and the total scores can be calculated from the data. This emperical curve is then be compared to the model-based CICC to visualize item fit.
